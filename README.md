# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Purpose of this analysis is to assist with gathering data for a ride sharing company called PyBer. High-level we were able to provide analysis from the given data by comparing cities and regions by their total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
Urban city type had the highest total fares compared to suburban who came in second and rural which came last. Urban cities had the highest number of fares and drivers showing high demand and business transactions. Urban also had the lowest fare out of the three but this came because of the high demand and competitive number of drivers using PyBer in urban areas. Rural had the highest fare but made sense since the number of drivers and rides were the lowest.

## Summary:
### Business Recommendations:
- For urban areas it seems that since there is a high number of rides and drivers the company has an opportunity to include incentive plans for PyBer customers and drivers to obtain more business.
- For suburban areas it seems that lowering the fee could drive up customer acquisition and incentivize customers to use the app.
- For rural areas it could be useful utilize marketing efforts in those communities to better gain customer rides.
